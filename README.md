# smoothscroll
A simple CSS-only system for smooth momentum scrolling in web apps across all sizes and devices.

After much trial and error in a large-scale responsive web app, I've found this to be the most successful technique for implementing consistent momentum scrolling while allowing for fixed headers and footers. Hope it helps!

## Usage
Either copy the .outside-scroller and .scroller classes into your Sass, or use the whole thing as a starting point for your responsive web app.
